Task 1: Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.

Make sure you include a non empty README.md in your directory:

    at the root of your repository alx-pre_course
    AND in the directory 0x01-git

Task 2: Inside 0x01-git:

    Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
    Create these empty files:
    c/c_is_fun.c
    js/main.js
    js/index.js
    Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
    Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
    Add all these new files to git
    Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

Task 3: For this project, create a branch update_script and in this branch:

    Create an empty file named bash/98
    Update bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
    Update bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
    Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
    Push this new branch Tips

Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

    Change branch to main
    Update the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
    Delete the directory js
    Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin
